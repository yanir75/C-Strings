# C-Strings

In this project we will use strings and perform few functions on the strings.

We will utilize 3 functions

1.Gematrical value, this function will receive a text and a word and will return all the words that has the same gematrical value.

2.Atbash cipher, upon receiving a word will return all the words in the text that match the atbash values.

3.Minimal string , upon receiving a string it will return the minimal strings in the text that match the "moved word".
*Moved word means moving all the characters in a word x times to the left/right.

Our script will receive a word , those characters mark the end of the word : " " (space) ,"\t" ,"\n".
Following those chars it will receive a text until receiving the following character "~".
After receiving the input, it will activate all the functions and will print the results.
